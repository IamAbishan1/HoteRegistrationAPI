This api handles user registration and user log in to the system.
Session handling is done using JTW token.

Once the user is logged in to the system, then the user can register a hotel for his/her business.
Also only the user with employee role can register a hotel.
A general user can only view the list of hotel already registered in the system.

This api also strictly validates input data while performing differnt processes.
